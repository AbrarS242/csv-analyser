# Program Overview #

This program analyses data from numeric CSV files. There are multiple commmands available for the user to input, each of which causes the program to perform a specific task:
* **i** (index) - displays the headings in the CSV file
* **a** (analyse) - provides overall stats about the specified columns of data
* **d** (display) - prints out the specified columns of data, indicating how many consecutive rows have the same values
* **s** (sort) - sorts the data according to the specified columns
* **p** (plot) - creates a frequency histogram of all the data in the specified columns

## Note ##
This program was written as an assignment for the subject COMP10002 Foundations of Algorithms at the University of Melbourne. 
The skeleton code has been written by Alistair Moffat (ammoffat@unimelb.edu.au).
